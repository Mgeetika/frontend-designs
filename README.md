# Frontend Practice Projects

This repository contains all the frontend code I have written while learning frontend development.  
Each folder/project represents different concepts, designs, or components I explored during my learning journey.

## What's Inside

- Responsive website layouts  
- UI components  
- Bootstrap designs  
- JavaScript interactions  
- Practice projects and experiments

## Technologies Used

- HTML  
- CSS  
- JavaScript  
- Bootstrap

## Folder Structure

Each folder is a separate mini project or component I built during my practice sessions. Some are complete websites, while others are UI elements like cards, navbars, or forms.

## Screenshots

All image previews of the frontend designs are stored in the `project images` folder for quick reference.

## Disclaimer

All the designs used in these projects are taken from online sources and are not originally created by me.  
I recreated them for learning and practice purposes only.

## Note

This code is purely for learning and practice purposes. Feedback and suggestions are always welcome.
